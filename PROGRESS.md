# PROGRESS — espansoConfig

**This file is the authoritative project state.** The conversation is not. A fresh session
should be able to resume from this file alone, without any conversation history.

Plan of record: [`IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`](IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md) (§12 holds the phase plan).

---

## Status

| Phase | Scope | State |
|---|---|---|
| **0a** | Workspace scaffold · golden corpus · parser evaluation | ✅ complete |
| **0b-1** | Byte-accurate span layer: `CharToByte`, BOM/line endings, `SyntaxIndex`, span trimming | ✅ complete |
| **0b-2** | Gap scanner: trivia classification and comment ownership | 🚧 in progress |
| **0c** | Patch engine · `choose_scalar` · round-trip property test | ⬜️ not started |
| 1 | Read-only browser | ⬜️ blocked on the Phase 0 gate |
| 2–5 | See plan §12 | ⬜️ not started |

Phase 0 as written in the plan was split into **0a / 0b / 0c** because it was too large for one
coherent unit of work. The plan's stated exit criterion for Phase 0 — *the round-trip property
test passes on the full corpus* — is unchanged and lands at the end of **0c**. The architectural
gate is not cleared until then; no UI work begins before it.

## Completed

### Phase 0a — foundation, corpus, parser evaluation

**Workspace.** Cargo workspace at the repo root with a single crate,
[`crates/espansoconfig-core/`](crates/espansoconfig-core/), which has **no tauri dependency** and
never will (verified: `rg -c tauri Cargo.lock` finds nothing). Module skeleton follows plan §6.1:
`discovery` · `syntax` · `model` · `patch` · `emit` · `validate` · `persist` · `watch`.
`#![deny(missing_docs)]` and `-D warnings` are on from the first commit.

**Implemented for real:** [`discovery.rs`](crates/espansoconfig-core/src/discovery.rs) — config
directory resolution (explicit override → `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/espanso` →
`~/Library/Application Support/espanso`), recursive file enumeration, and classification into
match file / config profile / package, with the `_`-prefixed-disabled flag. 13 unit tests against
synthetic temp trees.

**Defined as types** (from plan §6.2), everything else is a documented stub: `ByteSpan`,
`ScalarStyle`, `Chomping`, `ScalarPresentation`, `ContentRevision` (sha256), `LineEnding`,
`DocumentId`, `SourceDocument`.

**Golden corpus.** 19 valid synthetic fixtures + 4 deliberately invalid ones, in
[`crates/espansoconfig-core/tests/corpus/synthetic/`](crates/espansoconfig-core/tests/corpus/synthetic/),
covering every category in plan §11: all scalar styles, comments in every position, blank-line
runs, anchors/aliases/tags/merge keys, duplicate keys, flow collections, multi-document streams,
CRLF, BOM, no-trailing-newline, non-ASCII (Spanish accents and `⌘`/`⌥`/`⇧`), plus espanso shapes
(form + `choice`, a `form`→`date`→`shell` variable chain, `html`, `imports`, `global_vars`).
Two fixtures were added when the Phase 0a review was closed out: `block-scalars.yml` (the full
`|`/`>` × clip/strip/keep × explicit-indent matrix) and `unicode-offsets.yml` (precomposed `é`,
**decomposed** `é`, astral `😀`, `tail` — the file that pins the offset-counting scheme, and
which must never be Unicode-normalised).

**Parser evaluation.** [`docs/parser-evaluation.md`](docs/parser-evaluation.md) — the full
scorecard, probe evidence and division of labour. Backed by 31 executable tests in
[`tests/parser_evaluation.rs`](crates/espansoconfig-core/tests/parser_evaluation.rs) that pin
every measured behaviour. An adversarial review
([`docs/reviews/phase-0a-parser-substrate.md`](docs/reviews/phase-0a-parser-substrate.md))
found four verification holes; all four are now closed, and one of them **overturned a headline
claim** (see D2).

---

## Decisions (and why — this is what a fresh session cannot re-derive)

### D1 — the real espanso config is never committed

The GitHub repo `ccarpiog/espansoConfig` is **public**, and the owner's live config contains
personal email templates. The product owner chose: **real files stay out of git.**

- Committed fixtures are **synthetic only**, with neutral content.
- [`scripts/sync-real-corpus.sh`](scripts/sync-real-corpus.sh) copies the live config into
  `crates/espansoconfig-core/tests/corpus/real/`, which is **gitignored**
  (`.gitignore:107`).
- [`tests/real_corpus.rs`](crates/espansoconfig-core/tests/real_corpus.rs) **skips cleanly** when
  that directory is absent, so a fresh clone and any CI still pass.

This supersedes plan §11's "checked into the repo" wording for the real-file tier. Do not
re-litigate it, and **never** paste real config content into a committed file, a doc, or a
report.

### D2 — parser substrate is `saphyr-parser` 0.0.11 plus two adapters we own

`saphyr-parser` is the only one of the three candidates that reports where a node **ends**, and
span surgery is impossible without that.

**Corrected by the Phase 0a review.** The first write-up claimed end offsets were "exact, every
style". That is true for **flow** scalars — 727 in the synthetic corpus and 980 in the 13 real
files reproduce their source token byte for byte, zero mismatches — and **false for block
scalars**. A `|`/`>` span's end is the position of the next non-whitespace character, so it
swallows trailing blank lines and the next line's indentation: 30 of 31 block scalars in the
synthetic corpus and **80 of 87 in the real corpus** overshoot. The old test hid this by
asserting `ScalarStyle::Literal | ScalarStyle::Folded => true` while still counting those
scalars toward the headline figure.

The block-scalar end is still *usable*: it is reconstructible from the reported span, the
`Marker::col()` indentation and the header's chomping indicator, and all 31 corpus block scalars
re-decode byte-for-byte from those three inputs.

Rejected: `yaml-rust2` 0.11 (start `Marker` only, no end) and `marked-yaml` 0.8 (scalar `end()`
is always `None`; also drags in an older `yaml-rust2` 0.10 and rejects anchors outright).

The parser is **not** sufficient alone. Two adapters are ours:

1. **`CharToByte` table.** All three crates report offsets counted in **Unicode scalar values**
   (exactly Rust's `char`) — not bytes, not UTF-16 code units, not grapheme clusters, and despite
   saphyr's own getter documentation claiming bytes. `unicode-offsets.yml` separates all four
   schemes and the test asserts the three rivals are *wrong*. 29 of 33 spans in the non-ASCII
   fixture truncate if the value is trusted as a byte index. Silent-corruption trap, pinned.
2. **Gap scanner.** Comments, blank lines, block-scalar header text, chomping indicators and
   anchor names are exposed by *no* parser — but all of them fall in the gaps *between* reported
   spans. So the scanner is a **gap lexer, not a YAML lexer**: it never decides what a scalar is,
   because the parser already said. This confirms plan §6.2's anticipated outcome while making
   the scanner's job much smaller than feared.

### D2c — one content-start convention for every block scalar

Closed out from the Phase 0b-1 review
([`docs/reviews/phase-0b-1-span-layer.md`](docs/reviews/phase-0b-1-span-layer.md)),
whose top-ranked failure mode was that the span layer used **two** conventions: an
ordinary block started at the first content *character*, leaving that line's indentation
in the gap, while a block opening with empty lines started just past the header's break.
A uniform emitter cannot serve both and would under- or double-indent the first line,
changing YAML structure rather than a value.

**The content span now always begins immediately after the line break that terminates the
header line**, so it carries every body line's indentation, the first included. Decoding is
uniformly "strip `indent` columns from each line", replacement is uniformly "write whole,
`indent`-indented lines", and a block opening with blank lines needs no special case. The
rule is documented on `ScalarPresentation::content_span` and enforced across all three
shapes — ordinary, leading-blank, truncated header (R5) — by
`every_block_shape_uses_the_same_content_start_convention` in `tests/syntax_index.rs`.

Two consequences worth recording:

- A block scalar's reported *end* is no longer the only overshoot: the reported **start**
  is one line's indentation too late for every ordinary block, which
  `docs/parser-evaluation.md`'s "block-scalar start — exact, at the content indent column"
  overstated.
- Corpus-wide blank-line recovery from the gaps dropped from 667 to 636 over the original
  19 fixtures — exactly the 31 block scalars in them. Each one used to leave its first
  line's indentation in the preceding gap, where a per-gap line scan counted that fragment
  as a blank line it never was. The figure is real recovery now, not an artefact.

### D2b — the gap frontier is **trimmed leaf spans**

Measured, not assumed: saphyr's spans **do not nest**. Block collection markers are zero width,
flow ones cover exactly one bracket, document markers exactly `---`/`...`; no non-leaf span
encloses a leaf span anywhere in the corpus. So the review's predicted failure — a comment lost
inside a mapping span — does not occur, and complement-of-all-spans loses no comment today.

It is still the wrong definition. **The frontier is `Scalar` and `Alias` spans only, with every
block-scalar end trimmed to its true content end.** Reasons, both measured:

- Untrimmed, the frontier loses 36 blank lines corpus-wide (631 vs 667) inside block-scalar
  spans — trivia by YAML's own chomping rules.
- Leaf-only rather than all-spans because it stays correct if a future saphyr release gives
  collections real enclosing extents, which is exactly the change the review anticipated.

### D3b — incomplete input never panics

21 054 prefixes of the valid corpus plus 15 hand-written half-states: **0 panics**, 11 clean
errors with a char index + line + column, 4 accepted. Two accepted classes produce misleading
spans and need Phase 0b guards: a truncated block header (`replace: |`) reports a span that
*includes* the header — the only case where that happens — and implicit/empty nodes produce
zero-width spans.

### D3 — the BOM is stripped and recorded before the parser runs

No parser strips it, and a BOM preceding a comment makes the parse fail outright. `SourceDocument`
carries a `bom` flag so the byte is restored verbatim on write.

## Open risks and deviations

| # | Risk | Mitigation / state |
|---|---|---|
| R1 | `saphyr-parser` is **pre-1.0 (0.0.11)**; the API can break between patch releases | Confined to `crate::syntax` — no other module imports it. 31 pinned tests fail loudly on any behaviour change. Deliberately **not** vendored: vendoring creates ownership without removing upgrade risk. |
| R2 | If a future saphyr release "fixes" `index()` to genuinely return bytes, the `CharToByte` adapter silently becomes wrong | Desired failure mode already wired: `all_three_crates_report_character_offsets_not_byte_offsets` and `saphyr_offsets_count_unicode_scalar_values_not_bytes_utf16_units_or_graphemes` both fail immediately. |
| R3 | **Block-scalar** and block **collection** end offsets overshoot into trailing trivia | Must be trimmed by us. The block-scalar trim rule is derived and asserted in 0a; applying it is 0b, and collection trimming is 0c. |
| R4 | Phase 0 gate is **not yet cleared** — the round-trip property test does not exist yet | Lands in 0c. No UI work until it passes. |
| R5 | An empty block scalar (`replace: \|` mid-keystroke) reports a span that **includes** its header — the one exception to "the header is outside the span" | Phase 0b: the backwards header lexer must refuse to run when the span itself starts with `\|` or `>`. Pinned by `a_truncated_block_scalar_header_produces_a_span_that_swallows_the_header`. The content span now starts past the header *line*, never past the indicator alone, so rewriting it cannot splice a value onto the header line. |
| R6 | **Flow-collection comment ownership** is undefined: in `items: [one, # why` / `two]` the comment belongs to no obvious node | Phase 0b/0c. Value replacement can ignore it; delete/move/insert cannot. An explicit attachment policy is required before those operations ship. |
| R7 | **Empty and implicit nodes** (`empty:`, bare `- `, `? key` / `: value`, compact `- key: value`) create zero-width or shared boundaries with no unique owner | Phase 0b. The shape of the problem is measured in `implicit_and_empty_nodes_produce_zero_width_spans`; the ownership policy is still to be written. |
| R8 | **Merge keys and aliases** can defeat a path resolver that assumes key/value scalar pairs — `<<` arrives as an ordinary scalar key, aliases are not scalar values | Phase 0b path resolution must classify these syntactically rather than positionally. |
| R9 | The missing evaluation criterion is **replacement-envelope correctness**, not endpoint accuracy | Phase 0c. Mutate real documents and assert: the span matches the requested structural path despite duplicate keys, nested sequence mappings, merge keys, aliases, explicit keys and empty values; the replacement reparses to the intended value and stays valid YAML; every byte outside the envelope is identical (CRLF/LF, BOM, missing final newline, trailing spaces, comments, block-scalar terminal newlines). This is the Phase 0 gate's round-trip property test. |
| R10 | A block scalar whose header cannot be located has **no correct span**: the reported one runs into trailing blank lines and the next node's indentation | The index is **rejected** with `InvariantViolation::BlockHeaderNotFound` rather than publishing the known-bad span. There is deliberately no fallback. From the Phase 0b-1 review, ranked failure mode 3. |
| R11 | **Terminal spaces or tabs at end-of-source** are scalar content, not the next token's indentation — there is no next token | `block::content_len` takes `at_end_of_source` and keeps a trailing run that sits on a content line. Pinned by `terminal_spaces_at_end_of_source_stay_inside_the_block_scalar` and the `block-scalar-terminal-spaces.yml` fixture. |

## Verification — Phase 0a

All run at the repo root, all exit 0:

| Command | Result |
|---|---|
| `cargo build --workspace` | exit 0 |
| `cargo test --workspace` | exit 0 — **62 tests pass** (20 unit + 7 corpus integrity + 31 parser evaluation + 4 real corpus) |
| `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings` | exit 0, no warnings |
| `cargo fmt --check` | exit 0 |
| `git check-ignore -v crates/espansoconfig-core/tests/corpus/real/match/sql.yml` | ignored via `.gitignore:107` ✅ |
| `git status --short --untracked-files=all` | **no real-config path present** ✅ |

Byte-exactness of the awkward fixtures, confirmed with `xxd`: CRLF file contains `0d0a`; BOM file
starts `efbb bf`; no-trailing-newline file ends `0x27` (`'`) with no `0a`; `unicode-offsets.yml`
contains `c3a9` (precomposed é), `65cc81` (**decomposed** é) and `f09f9880` (😀).
`git hash-object`, `--no-filters` and `-c core.autocrlf=true` all agree, proving the corpus
`.gitattributes` `-text` rule stops CRLF normalisation.

## Next action

**Start Phase 0b — the span-accurate `SyntaxIndex`.**

Build `crate::syntax` on `saphyr-parser`, producing a `SyntaxIndex` where every node carries a
correct **byte** `ByteSpan`, plus attributed trivia. The division of labour is already worked out
in [`docs/parser-evaluation.md`](docs/parser-evaluation.md) §"Division of labour for Phase 0b" —
read that table first; it says exactly which fact comes from the parser and which from our
scanner.

Specifically:

1. `CharToByte` offset table over `char_indices()` (Unicode scalar values — confirmed, see D2),
   built once per document; convert every saphyr span on the way in so no char offset ever
   escapes `crate::syntax`. Reject offsets outside its domain rather than saturating.
2. BOM strip + record before parsing; `LineEnding` detection.
3. Gap scanner over the **trimmed leaf frontier** (D2b) — the byte ranges no `Scalar`/`Alias`
   span claimed, after every block-scalar end has been trimmed: comments, blank lines and runs,
   block-scalar headers (`|`, `|-`, `|+`, `>`, explicit indent indicators), chomping, anchor
   names. Guard the backwards header lexer against the empty-block case (R5).
4. Comment ownership per plan **§6.2** — contiguous comments directly above a sequence item with
   no blank line belong to that item; a comment separated by a blank line belongs to the file;
   inline comments belong to their mapping entry; **file-header comments before the first
   top-level key never belong to the first match**.
5. Trim collection-end overshoot (R3).

**Acceptance for 0b:** for every valid corpus fixture *and* every real file when present, each
node's recorded `ByteSpan` slices out of the original source to exactly the expected text, and
the concatenation of all spans and gaps reconstructs the file byte-for-byte. That
reconstruction test is the natural precursor to 0c's round-trip property test.

## Git state

_Updated at each phase boundary._

| Phase | Commit | Push | Tree |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0a | `10f3e70` | ✅ pushed to `origin/main` | clean |

Note: commit `123f5c0` ("Ignore the .claude directory and untrack its settings") landed
out-of-band between the plan commit and 0a. It untracks `.claude/settings.json` and ignores
`.claude/`. Benign and left in place.
